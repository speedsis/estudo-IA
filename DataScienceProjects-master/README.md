## Overview

In this repository, you will find the source code to various projects I have been working on or still work-in-progress. The majority of the projects are accompanied by a Medium blog posts at [medium.com/@tuandoan.nguyen](https://medium.com/@tuandoan.nguyen). I published almost exclusively on Towards Data Science publication through Medium's Partnership program so please check out these articles as a way to support me and my future projects. Alternatively, you can also find my blog posts at my personal website [here](https://tuangauss.github.io/).

My interests lie in the intersection of statistical techniques, data visualization and sports (especially football). All the codes are written entirely in Python or R. I don't have a strong preference or attempt to make a concerted effort to code in a specific language/platform. The decision is mostly based on how specific functionalities needed for a project are supported (scraping in Python and data processing with dplyr piping in R).

#### The statistics of modern football:
A collection of projects that explore the intricate statistical aspect of the Beautiful Game

- [Empirical Bayes and penalty taking ability](https://towardsdatascience.com/men-of-steel-finding-the-best-penalty-takers-with-empirical-bayes-estimation-aa0e126fb08b) Using Bayesian statistics to make meaningful comparison between players across Europe.
- [Poisson process and match prediction](https://towardsdatascience.com/o-jogo-bonito-predicting-the-premier-league-with-a-random-model-1b02fa3a7e5a) - Here we learn about the Poisson process and how a random model outperforms football experts with its prediction.
- [The mathematics of football betting strategies](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-big-bucks-with-a-data-driven-sports-betting-strategy-6c21a6869171) - With the Poisson model and some additional help from mathematical research, can we beat the bookies?
- [Fisher vs Neyman-Person debate and Paul the Octopus](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-can-an-octopus-tell-us-about-the-biggest-debate-in-statistical-theory-f017295d781f) - We went over the theory (or many theories) of hypothesis testings and see how they apply to the psychic ability of Paul the Octopus.

#### Statistical theory and its application:

- [Bayes theorem and a probabilistic argument for God](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-bayesian-quest-to-find-god-b30934972473)
- [Dating with probability theory](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-theory-and-the-optimal-dating-strategy-for-2018-2b75b26fb0b) - Here we explore what probability theory has to say about the most optimal strategy to find the love of your life.
- [Bayes theorem and why it matters to my workout routine](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-bayesian-statistics-convinced-me-to-hit-the-gym-fa737b0a7ac): A lightweight introduction to Bayes' theorem and how it helps convince me to hit the gym.

### General tutorials with Python and R:

#### Data visualization:
- [NetworkX and Basemap](https://towardsdatascience.com/catching-that-flight-visualizing-social-network-with-networkx-and-basemap-ce4a0d2eaea6) - Here is a comprehensive tutorial of how we can visualize geographical data with powerful tools that support Python.
- [Tkinter and Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/having-your-own-fun-how-to-build-your-own-macys-firework-show-with-python-and-tkinter-79cc31631b44) - Building your own firework shows with Tkinter (and some math chops).
- [Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn](https://towardsdatascience.com/advanced-sports-visualization-with-pandas-matplotlib-and-seaborn-9c16df80a81b) - Learn how to construct publish-worthy visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn packages.

#### Machine Learning practicals:
- [End-to-end Machine Learning project with R](https://github.com/tuangauss/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/R/end_to_end_projects.R) - Here is a full data science project that covers data collection, cleaning, visualization, machine learning and validation.
- [Unsupervised Learning - Clustering method with R](https://github.com/tuangauss/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/R/EPL/Misc/TeamEvaluate2015.R) - An introduction to an array of unsupervised learning algorithms: Hierachical clustering, k-means, and Factor Analysis.
